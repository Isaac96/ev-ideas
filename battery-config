Battery split between front and back
Main contactors, precharge and power, in original 12V battery box with DC-DC converter
Contactors between front and back packs
Additional contactor for DC-DC converter
Precharge relay is controlled by ACC switch in ignition, but has a NC inertia switch between in case of collision
ACC switch also powers up DC-DC, and therefore GEVCU
GEVCU controls power contactor, with usual precharge delay; additional enable switch as well as RUN switch in ignition
Green enable switch in dash with light ring, light ring turns on when precharge is finished and ignition is in RUN
GEVCU ignores ACC mode, only begins precharge count when in RUN
