motor max RPM: 7500 best efficiency @3500, 
5.2:1 with 808 R/mile = 4551 rpm at 65mph
plenty of torque
motor in standard spot connecting to tranny
875 wheel rpm @65mph 
808 R/mile

Keep a shifter somewhere? synchromesh will let it all slide together-eventually make a simple automatic tranny
do tests in each gear for acceleration, top speed, Ah used, motor temp etc.
