motor coupling: blank from evwest -> flex shaft coupler -> 4.88:1 ratio diff 

motor max RPM: 7500 best efficiency @3500, 
4.88:1 with 808 R/mile = 4200 rpm at 65mph
plenty of torque
motor behind rear axle using 4.88g:1 front diff
motor right side up with controller on side
motor shaft to flex coupler to diff
motor is 424mm long plus adapter plus flex then diff?
anything needed to connect flex shaft to diff input shaft?

4:1 diff will be satisfactory if motor can produce 400 lb-ft of torque at 3500rpm for 10s
upgraded diff not necessary? still need new one
motor won't fit behind axle, get rear diff
motor goes in trunk, diagonally
